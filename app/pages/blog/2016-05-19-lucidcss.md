Over the past years, I've tried many CSS style guides. I've tried OOCSS; I've tried SMACSS; I've tried naming conventions like BEM; I've tried company-wide style guides like Trello's Style Guide. All of them were *okay*, but I felt that they were missing something.


I want to share with everyone my CSS style guide that I have been experimenting with and found great success with. I call it LucidCSS.

I believe that there are three goals to any CSS style guide:

1. Maintainable and scalable.
2. Allows for rapid development.
3. Overcomes specificity problems.

*LucidCSS* adds a fourth goal:

4. Extremely simple.

CSS is complicated as heck, and I believe that we should strive to make our CSS writing as simple as possible.

My style guide is detailed here: [lucidcss.io](http://lucidcss.io).
