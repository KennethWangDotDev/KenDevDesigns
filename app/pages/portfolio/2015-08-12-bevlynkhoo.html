description:       "Bevlyn Khoo is a talented independent musician from Singapore. She reached out to me because she was unsatisfied with her existing self-made website. In the next month, I worked closely with her and designed a new website that fit her needs. The new site is fully integrated with various social media and has new features such as eCommerce. For the first time, her fans can now support her by purchasing her songs digitally directly from her."
