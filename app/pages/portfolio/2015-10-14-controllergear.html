shortDescription: "I designed and implemented an eCommerce solution that supports a plethora of shipping methods, so gamers all over the world can easily access their products."

description:       "When the marketing team of ControllerGear approached me, their entire eCommerce solution was a mess. Shipping prices were high, taxes were wrong, and international shipping was not functional at all. I did a complete review of their eCommerce system and helped them fix every problem. I implemented FedEx Shipping Options and USPS Shipping Options which lowered the shipping prices and gave users more options. I then hooked up their taxation system with TaxCloud.net’s service, which automated the tax prices for all domestic states as well as international shipping. Finally, I implemented ShipStation’s service using their API to facilitate the shipping process. In addition, I designed various parts of the frontend."
