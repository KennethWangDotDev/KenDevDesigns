description: "Brotherwise Games is an independent board games company founded by two brothers. After the huge success of their $200,000 Kickstarter campaign, they decided that they needed a new branding. They intended to publish more board games and wanted to differentiate their company from their flagship game. I helped them make various decisions on how to do that, and designed for them a completely new website."
