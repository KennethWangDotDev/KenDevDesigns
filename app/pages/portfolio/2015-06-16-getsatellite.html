description:       "I worked together with Satellite Country, one of the biggest DISH retailers in the United States, to re-design their old site. The goal of the redesign was to give the website a fresh and modern look, while also generating more leads and customers. The website was built on top of a heavily modified version of WordPress CMS so employees with no development experience could easily modify the website's content. In total, the website contains over 300 pages, and over 10 custom plugins, including a TV channel overview system."

technologies: "HTML5/CSS3, WordPress, Custom WordPress Theme & Plugin Development, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery"
