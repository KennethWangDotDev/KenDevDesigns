shortDescription: "I took a wristwatch brand's dated website and redesigned it with a focus on opulence that reflects the company's products."

description:       "LUXWATCHES is a high-class wristwatch brand that seeks to produce the highest quality watches. Their products were excellent, but they felt that their dated website was holding them back. I did a complete re-design of both the frontend and the backend using the latest technologies. It is easy to navigate, yet also has a luxurious and classy feel to it."

testimonial: "I approached Kenneth, asking him to redesign LUXWATCHES with a tight deadline of a week. In a short timeframe, Kenneth delivered a beautiful website that completely exceeded my expectations. He is an amazing designer and I recommend him to everyone."
