description: "LucidCSS is a style guide that I developed that completely revolutionizes the way CSS is organized and structured. The core foundation of LucidCSS is that CSS should be <em>extremely simple</em>. When things are simple, they are also maintainable. Instead of focusing on DRY concepts and perfect byte optimizations, LucidCSS focuses on simplicity."
